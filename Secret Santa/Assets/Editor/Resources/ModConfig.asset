  description: "Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It is
    like this\r tangible thing that you can point to and say, \u201CHey man, I love
    you this many\r dollars worth.\u201D\r\n\nFind what's inside each present by shaking
    the bomb, and find which one is outside the price range.\n\nMerry Christmas everyone!\n\nThanks
    to Vincology for the manual.\n\nManual can be found at ktane.timwi.de or in the
    manuals folder of your game.\n\nIf there are any bugs, contact VFlyer or Deaf
    on the KTANE Discord."
